# Sudoku Solver

## Project Description
The project aims at solving Sudoku by encoding the problem into propositional logic stored as a conjunction of disjunctions of literals. The knowledge will be then sent to the `maplechrono` in PySat for finiding the solution in propositional logic form. The program will then decode it and render the solution to the `index.html`.
